// By default, use entities as models and only map them when necessary.
//
// Use cases MUST receive model objects as parameters, internally map them to
// entities, and then operate and CONVERT BACK those entities to model objects
// in order to return any information.
// It is important do not LEAK domain entities outside use case boundaries.
//
// However, domain providers MUST receive and return entity objects and are
// responsible of internally convert them to any appropiate data structure
// needed for external services interaction.
